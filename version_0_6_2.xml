			This release includes an initial implementation of <a href="http://www.fastcgi.com">FastCGI</a>.
			While the existing functionality wasn't logically altered, it was shuffled around quite a lot and abstracted to
			accomodate for the new FastCGI functions.
			The implementation is documented in <a href="kfcgi.8.html">kfcgi(8)</a>, <a
				href="khttp_fcgi_init.3.html">khttp_fcgi_init(3)</a>, and <a
				href="khttp_fcgi_parse.3.html">khttp_fcgi_parse(3)</a>, and <a
				href="khttp_fcgi_free.3.html">khttp_fcgi_free(3)</a>.
			<strong>This functionality is experimental</strong>, and needs strong analysis before casual deployment.
			It is also not quite feature-complete: HTTP compression is not yet functional for FastCGI applications.
			The <a href="kfcgi.8.html">kfcgi(8)</a> launcher is also very bare-bones&#8212;this will be improved in subsequent releases.
			Again: this functionality is <strong>experimental</strong> and under development!

			Also fixed a bug where calling <a href="khttp_free.3.html">khttp_free(3)</a> after a prior <a
				href="khttp_parse.3.html">khttp_parse(3)</a> failure would cause a NULL dereference.
			Added the missing <code>txt</code> and <code>xml</code> suffixes to the suffix table.
			Fix that the request port number was erroneously disallowed to be &gt;80.
