.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn kcgi_regress_cgi
and
.Fn kcgi_regress_fcgi
functions are used for automated testing of
.Xr kcgi 3
systems, both as CGI and FastCGI scripts.
It is the mechanism used for internal regression tests as well.
.Pp
To compile and link, use
.Xr pkg-config 1
as follows:
.Bd -literal
% cc `pkg-config --cflags kcgi libcurl` -c -o sample.o sample.c
% cc -o sample sample.o `pkg-config --libs kcgi libcurl`
.Ed
.Pp
Some systems use a distinct
.Xr curl-config 1 .
.Pp
Applications wishing to use this framework provide callback functions to
.Fn kcgi_regress_cgi
and
.Fn kcgi_regress_fcgi ,
which invoke
.Fa server
with argument
.Fa serverArg
within a CGI or FastCGI environment as if it were spawned by a web
server, upon which the usual
.Xr khttp_parse 3
or
.Xr khttp_fcgi_init 3
and
.Xr khttp_fcgi_parse 3
functions are used to test behaviour.
Meanwhile, the
.Fa client
function is invoked for communicating with the server over port 17123.
The
.Xr libcurl 3
library is used for internal testing on the client side.
.Pp
In most applications, the main function invokes
.Fn kcgi_regress_cgi
or
.Fn kcgi_regress_fcgi ,
prepares a libCURL request in the client callback, then runs the usual
.Xr kcgi 3
sequence in the server callback.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Both the
.Fa client
and
.Fa server
functions should return zero on test failure.
.Fn kcgi_regress_cgi
and
.Fn kcgi_regress_fcgi
return zero if any tests or internal machinery fail.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following regression test simple checks whether a given URL,
.Pa login.json ,
is recognised (and returns HTTP error code 200) by CGI script
.Pa foobar ,
which is assumed to be accessible by
.Xr execl 3 .
