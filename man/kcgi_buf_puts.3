.In kcgi.h
.Ft enum kcgi_err
.Fo kcgi_buf_puts
.Fa "struct kcgi_buf *buf"
.Fa "const char *cp"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Appends a NUL-terminated string
.Fa cp
to a buffer
.Fa buf .
Buffers must be initialised to zero with
.Xr memset 3
prior to first use.
Does nothing if
.Fa cp
is
.Dv NULL .
It does not append a newline like
.Xr puts 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Returns an
.Ft enum kcgi_err
indicating the error state.

.It Dv KCGI_OK
Success (not an error).
.It Dv KCGI_ENOMEM
Internal memory allocation failure.
.It Dv KCGI_HUP
The output connection has been terminated.
For FastCGI connections, the current connection should be released with
.Xr khttp_free 3
and parse loop reentered.
.It Dv KCGI_FORM
The connection is still expecting headers with
.Xr khttp_head 3 .
Indicates that
.Xr khttp_body 3
did not return with success or was not invoked.
For FastCGI connections, the current connection should be released with
.Xr khttp_free 3
and parse loop reentered.

.Sh EXAMPLES
The following creates a simple NUL-terminated buffer and outputs its
contents.
It does not perform any error checking.
.Bd -literal -offset indent

memset(&buf, 0, sizeof(struct kcgi_buf));
kcgi_buf_puts(&buf, "Hello, world!");
