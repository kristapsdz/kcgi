.Dt KJSON_OPEN 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm kjson_open
.Nd open kcgijson context
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libkcgijson
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In stdarg.h
.In stdint.h
.In kcgi.h
.In kcgijson.h
.Ft enum kcgi_err
.Fo kjson_open
.Fa "struct kjsonreq *req"
.Fa "struct kreq *r"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Zeroes and initialises a new context
.Fa req
with the underlying
.Xr kcgi 3
context
.Fa r
as allocated with
.Xr khttp_parse 3
or
.Xr khttp_fcgi_parse 3 .
It should only be called after
.Xr khttp_body 3 .
.Pp
The scope open after initialisation is the
.Qq root
scope, which accepts similar content as arrays such as
.Xr kjson_putstring 3
instead of
.Xr kjson_putstringp 3 .
.Pp
If
.Xr kcgi_writer_disable 3
has been called, the process will be killed with an uncatchable signal.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Returns an
.Ft enum kcgi_err
indicating the error state.
.Bl -tag -width -Ds
.It Dv KCGI_OK
Success (not an error).
.It Dv KCGI_ENOMEM
Internal memory allocation failure.
.It Dv KCGI_HUP
The output connection has been terminated.
For FastCGI connections, the current connection should be released with
.Xr khttp_free 3
and parse loop reentered.
.It Dv KCGI_FORM
The connection is still expecting headers with
.Xr khttp_head 3 .
Indicates that
.Xr khttp_body 3
did not return with success or was not invoked.
For FastCGI connections, the current connection should be released with
.Xr khttp_free 3
and parse loop reentered.
.It Dv KCGI_SYSTEM
Internal system error writing to the output stream.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following outputs a simple JSON page.
It assumes
.Va r
is a
.Vt struct kreq
pointer.
For brevity, it does not do any error checking.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
khttp_head(r, kresps[KRESP_STATUS],
  "%s", khttps[KHTTP_200]);
khttp_head(r, kresps[KRESP_CONTENT_TYPE],
  "%s", kmimetypes[KMIME_APP_JSON]);
khttp_body(r);
kjson_open(&req, r);
kjson_obj_open(&req);
kjson_putstringp(&req, "foo", "bar");
kjson_close(&req);
