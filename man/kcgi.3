.Dt KCGI 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm kcgi
.Nd minimal CGI library in C
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libkcgi
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm kcgi
library handles the CGI environment for C web applications.
Interfacing applications generally work as follows:
.Bl -enum
.It
Call
.Xr khttp_parse 3
as early as possible.
This will parse and validate input fields and cookies with the
.Xr kvalid_string 3
family of functions or those provided by the calling application.
It will do so
.Em in memory ,
so enormous requests (e.g., files) will occur entirely in memory!
It also sets up the HTTP environment: compression, paths, MIME types, and so on.
.It
Process input fields by examining the
.Vt "struct kpair"
elements.
.It
Emit HTTP headers with
.Xr khttp_head 3 ,
followed by
.Xr khttp_body 3
to begin the HTTP body.
.It
Emit HTTP body output using the
.Xr khttp_template 3
templating system, the
.Xr khttp_write 3
family for general HTTP content, and/or an external library such as
.Xr kcgihtml 3 .
.Em \&Do not
use
.Xr printf 3
or other functions to append to standard output:
.Nm kcgi
will automatically compress output if requested by the client, and
overriding the output stream will circumvent this behaviour and might
mix compressed and uncompressed data.
.It
Call
.Xr khttp_free 3
to clean up.
.El
.Pp
To compile applications with
.Nm ,
make sure
.Pa kcgi.h
is in the header path and
.Pa libkcgi.a
in the library path, then link with
.Fl Ar lkcgi
and
.Fl Ar lz
.Pq unless compression has been disabled at compile-time .
For example,
.Bd -literal
% cc -I/usr/local/include -c -o sample.o sample.c
% cc -L/usr/local/lib -o sample -lkcgi -lz

.Sh STANDARDS
Many standards are involved in the
.Nm
library, most generally being draft RFC 3875,
.Qq The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) Version 1.1 .
.Bl -bullet
.It
The partial multipart form data support is defined by RFC 2388,
.Qq Returning Values from Forms: multipart/form-data ,
which is further defined by RFCs 2045 and 2046,
.Qq Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions .
.It
MIME type names are registered with IANA.
.It
URLs are formatted according to RFC 1630,
.Qq Universal Resource Identifiers in WWW .
.It
HTTP response headers are standardised in RFC 2616,
.Qq HTTP/1.1
and further in RFC 4229,
.Qq HTTP Header Field Registrations .
.It
Permanent URI schemes are registered with IANA.
.El
.Pp
Additional HTTP methods are defined by RFC 4918,
.Qq HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning ;
and RFC 4791 ,
.Qq Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV .
