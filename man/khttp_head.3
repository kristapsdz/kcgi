.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function emits HTTP headers for a
.Xr kcgi 3
context allocated by
.Xr khttp_parse 3 .
This may only be invoked prior to
.Xr khttp_body 3 ;
if not, its behaviour is undefined.
The
.Fa key
value should be an HTTP response pair key.
The
.Fa fmt
string and variable arguments, which follow
.Xr printf 3
syntax, should be the HTTP response pair value.
.Pp
The
.Va kresps
global array provides indexed HTTP response keys.
Use them!

See
.Xr khttp_body 3
for a discussion on the
.Dq Content-Encoding
header: do not specify this header before doing so!
.Sh EXAMPLES
To emit a cookie with key
.Dq foo
and value
.Dq bar
for the global path and without an expiration date, one may invoke the
following.
Assume that
.Fa r
is a context allocated by
.Xr khttp_parse 3 .
.Bd -literal
khttp_head(r, kresps[KRESP_SET_COOKIE],
