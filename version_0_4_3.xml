			Make sure that <a href="khttp_parse.3.html">khttp_parse(3)</a> returns an error code indicating what actually went wrong.
			This is a minor API change because the function no longer returns 0, but an enumeration (where 0, incidentally, means success).
			Also audit the parsing trailer to make sure that the parent doesn't exit in the event of memory exhaustion.
